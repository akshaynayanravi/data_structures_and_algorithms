"""
You are given list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of times.
Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list.
Your function should have the worst-case complexity of O(log N), where N is the length of the list.
You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.

Example: The list [5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4] was obtained by rotating the sorted list [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] 3 times.

We define "rotating a list" as removing the last element of the list and adding it before the first element.
E.g. rotating the list [3, 2, 4, 1] produces [1, 3, 2, 4].

"Sorted list" refers to a list where the elements are arranged in the increasing order e.g. [1, 3, 5, 7].


1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
